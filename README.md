# Oxagen house system

One design system for everything a customer sees from **Oxagen** and **Stella**:
the colours, the type, the two logos, the icons, the spinner, the wallpapers,
the social art, the ads, and the content cards.

**Start with [`playbook.html`](playbook.html).** It shows every asset, adapts
to light and dark, and works offline.

**Writing copy? Start in [`messages/`](messages/).** The registry holds every
line with its status, scope, evidence, and owner. [`message-bank.html`](message-bank.html)
is generated from it and shows every line, the held ones marked with their gate.

## The decision

The Oxagen brand kit is the house kit. It already had the right bones: Space
Grotesk, a warm near-black and a warm off-white, and a wordmark whose only
colour is one gold letter. This system takes that kit as the base and brings
Stella onto it.

- **oxagen** is the kit's wordmark, reproduced from the font: the word in
  Space Grotesk 600, lowercase, its **x** in gold.
- **stella\*** is the same word treatment followed by the font's own asterisk,
  in the same gold. The asterisk is a character, not a drawing. It is never
  redrawn.

Both are set at one em (the size the kit froze `oxagen` at), so they are the
same letter size exactly and the same height to within a pixel.

The gold is the kit's Bronze Gold `#C58A32` lifted one step in OKLCH: a little
lighter, a little richer, a few degrees toward yellow, so it reads as gold
rather than copper. That is `#D6962C`. `#F1C364` is the highlight the shimmer
passes through; `#8B5E1A` is gold as text on paper. Both names carry the one
value, so the two marks cannot drift apart.

Where a square is required, Stella uses its asterisk and Oxagen uses **the
hive**: six hexagonal cells on a honeycomb grid, four drawn as an outline and
two filled with the metal, one of them at half strength. It is the knowledge
graph as a picture -- a lattice, with the parts Oxagen has learned lit up --
and it is built from five numbers rather than drawn: a cell's height and
width, the pitch along a row, the pitch between rows, and the outline's
weight. The cells are a touch wider than a regular hexagon, which is what
makes the cluster stand square.

**The hive is two colours, and only two.** Its outlines take the colour of
whatever it sits on -- paper on ink, ink on paper, `currentColor` in the
adaptive files -- and its two lit cells take the metal: flat gold in the
plain files, the metal lit from above in the tiles. A mono file paints all
of it one colour. It is the app icon, the favicon and the avatar; the
wordmark is still what Oxagen prefers wherever there is room for a word.

The kit's continuous-loop monogram, the ox graph and the `Ox` lettermark are
all retired (September 2026); the kit's own file stays in `build/reference/`
as history.

Oxagen alone has a lockup: the hive, a gap, then the word. The hive stands a
quarter taller than the wordmark's box and centres on it. Stella has no
lockup; its asterisk is already in the word.

## Every pixel here is generated

No file in this kit is drawn by hand. Every PNG is a render of the SVG beside
it. Every SVG is emitted from `build/`. The colours live in one file,
`build/color.py`, so a change there moves every asset on the next run.

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install fonttools brotli pyyaml
brew install harfbuzz librsvg          # hb-shape and rsvg-convert
.venv/bin/python build/build.py --check   # verify the face, the palette, and the registry, write nothing
.venv/bin/python build/build.py           # every asset
.venv/bin/python build/build.py --svg     # skip the raster pass
.venv/bin/python build/build.py --only ads social   # only these steps
.venv/bin/python build/playbook.py        # rebuild the document
```

## Messages

Every line either brand publishes lives in [`messages/`](messages/), one YAML
file per entry: the headline or card itself, its short and long forms, who
reads it, where it is used, whether it is approved, whether it ships at launch
or waits for a capability, the scope sentence its short forms must keep, the
evidence it needs, its owner, and the date to review it. Retired lines stay in
the registry beside what replaced them. [`messages/README.md`](messages/README.md)
describes every field.

**A copy change starts in `messages/`.** `message-bank.html`,
`messages/index.json`, the ad copy, and the social taglines are generated from
it, so nothing downstream is edited by hand and nobody keeps a count of lines.

```sh
python3 build/messages.py --check          # validate the registry and confirm the generated files are current
python3 build/messages.py                  # write message-bank.html and messages/index.json
.venv/bin/python build/build.py --only ads social   # render the ads and taglines from the registry
```

The check fails on missing fields, a held entry without a gate, dashes or
exclamation points, words the voice guide avoids, unscoped claims, prospect
names, retired text in an approved entry, and any file in `ads/` that no
approved, launch-released ad entry produces.

## Install the branding skill

`skills/oxagen-branding/` is the Claude Code skill that carries the positioning,
the voice, the vocabulary, and worked examples, beside the marks it describes.
It is the source of truth for every word either brand publishes. The oxagen
monorepo vendors it through its own sync script; everything else installs it
from here.

```sh
skills/install.sh                          # link it into ~/.claude/skills, for every project on this machine
skills/install.sh --project ~/Projects/x   # copy it into one project's .claude/skills
skills/install.sh --check                  # does the installed skill match this checkout?
```

The per-user install is a symlink, so `git pull` here is the update. This skill
supersedes the older `brand-voice-guidelines` skill some machines still carry
under `~/.claude/skills`; the installer leaves that one alone.

For a PWA, copy `icons/oxagen-*.png`, `icons/oxagen-favicon.ico` and
`icons/oxagen.webmanifest` into the app's public folder and point at them:

```html
<link rel="icon" href="/oxagen-favicon.ico" sizes="any">
<link rel="icon" href="/oxagen-favicon.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/oxagen-icon-180.png">
<link rel="manifest" href="/oxagen.webmanifest">
```

`--check` reproduces the kit's shipped `oxagen` wordmark from the font (same
weight, same em, HarfBuzz spacing including kerning) and fails if the geometry
has moved. It also fails if the pinned gold stops matching its derivation from
the kit's Bronze Gold, or if any text token drops below AA on its ground.

## Rules worth knowing before you use it

- **One glyph is gold.** The x in oxagen, the asterisk in stella. Never a
  second one, never the whole word.
- **Gold is identity and at most one action per screen.** It is never a
  surface and it never encodes a state.
- **Gold as text on warm paper becomes `#8B5E1A`.** The mark keeps its metal;
  words do not.
- **Nothing sits to the left of stella.** The asterisk is the only mark.
- **Minimum 88 px** for a wordmark, **24 px** for an icon, **120 px** for the
  lockup. Below that, use the favicon.
- **The hive is two colours.** Outlines in the surface's ink, two cells in
  the metal. Never a third colour, never a filled outline, never rotated,
  never a cell moved.
- **The icon is the only picture we own.** No stock illustration, no gradient
  mesh, no 3D render. A surface that needs a picture builds one out of the
  icon -- its outline, its mosaic, a field around it (the `quiet`, `blocks`,
  `graph` and `orbit` wallpapers) -- or simply uses a bigger one.
- **Every ad explains one operator decision, and keeps its scope.** Mission
  Control introduces the control plane; authority, equipment, spend, and the
  keys each take one ad. The short forms keep the scope of the long ones:
  governed, recorded, mediated. Ad copy comes only from approved,
  launch-released entries in `messages/ads/`.
- **Space Grotesk is not a code face.** Terminal output and code stay in the
  system monospace.
